## V0.2.1alpha
- Adjusted the main UI form minimum constraints so that the resizable form must be at least 740x280 pixels. The main form cannot be resized to be smaller than this size. The minimum size may be changed in the future to accomidate new funcionality on the form.
- Fixed a few control positioning issues with the main form. 1. Hide Tree View control stays put. 2. Tree View expands vertically if the window is resized. 3. The Included files list expands both vertically and horizontally as the window is resized. 4. Total & Missing files counters move horizontally as the window expands.
## V0.2.0alpha

## V0.1.0alpha
- Update README.md
- initial commit of full repository
